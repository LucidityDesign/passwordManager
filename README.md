# Password Manager

Test implementation of a password manager using Qt and libsodium.

I used this project to learn C++ and explore cryptography concepts.

## Features

- Secure password storage using encryption
- User-friendly interface built with Qt
- Random password generation
- Auto-lock after a period of inactivity

## Compile and run

1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including Qt and libsodium (`brew install qt libsodium`).
1. `mkdir build`
1. `cd build`
1. `cmake ..`
1. `make`
1. `./passwordmanager.app/Contents/MacOS/passwordmanager`
